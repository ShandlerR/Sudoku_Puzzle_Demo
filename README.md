# Overview

This is my code for my Sudoku puzzle that will generate one corner of the puzzle, fill in 8 numbers, and provide feedback whether or
not the user entered the last number in right or wrong. I created this project as my first project using Android Studios. This is meant to 
be an introduction to Android studios and demonstrate a learning of the basics fundementals of the platform including using the activity_main
program to build a user interface involving Views, and using kotlin to code the backend.
